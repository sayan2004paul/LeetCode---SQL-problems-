175. Combine Two Tables :

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.
Return the result table in any order.

Soln :

SELECT 
 p.firstName , p.lastName,a.city ,a.state
FROM 
 Person p 
  LEFT JOIN 
   Address a 
    ON p.personId=a.personId




176. Second Highest Salary :
Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).


Soln :

SELECT IFNULL((SELECT 
  DISTINCT salary  
  FROM 
   Employee 
    ORDER BY 
     salary DESC
      LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),null) AS SecondHighestSalary


Optimised :

SELECT 
    MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary 
    FROM Employee 
    ORDER BY salary DESC 
    LIMIT 2
) AS temp
OFFSET 1;
